# timeplus stop

Stop the Timeplus Enterprise services in the current node.

## timeplus stop

When you run `timeplus stop` without extra parameters, it will stop all services, e.g.

```
stopping service timeplus_web
stopping service timeplus_appserver
stopping service timeplusd
stopping service timeplus_connector

service timeplus_connector stopped

service timeplus_appserver stopped

service timeplus_web stopped
..........
service timeplusd stopped
```

Usually all services will be stopped immediately, except `timeplusd`, which may take a few seconds or minutes, depending on the server workload.

## timeplus stop -s [service]

You can also use the `-s` or `--service` flag to stop a specific service, e.g.

```
timeplus stop -s timeplusd
stopping service timeplusd

service timeplusd stopped
```
