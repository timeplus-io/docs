## 语法

Create an external stream with the log type to monitor log files, e.g.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL STREAM proton_log(
  raw string
)
SETTINGS
type='log',
   log_files='proton-server.log',
   log_dir='/var/log/proton-server',
   timestamp_regex='^(\d{4}\.\d{2}\.\d{2} \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}\.\d+)',
   row_delimiter='(\d{4}\.\d{2}\.\d{2} \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}\.\d+) \[ \d+ \] \{'
```

The required settings:

- log_files
- log_dir
- timestamp_regex
- row_delimiter. Only 1 capturing group is expected in the regex.
