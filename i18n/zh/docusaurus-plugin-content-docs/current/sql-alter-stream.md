# 改变流

Currently we don't recommend to alter the schema of streams in Timeplus. You can modify the retention policy for historical store via [MODIFY TTL](#ttl) and modify the retention policy for streaming storage via [MODIFY SETTING](#stream_ttl).

You can also use `ALTER STREAM` to modify the settings of materialized views (only available in Timeplus Enterprise).

## MODIFY TTL{#ttl}

You can add or modify the retention policy. 例如 例如

```sql
ALTER STREAM stream_name MODIFY TTL
to_datetime(created_at) + INTERVAL 48 HOUR
```

## MODIFY SETTING{#stream_ttl}

You can add or modify the retention policy for streaming storage. 例如

```sql
ALTER STREAM stream_name MODIFY SETTING
logstore_retention_ms = ...,
logstore_retention_size = ...;
```

## MODIFY QUERY SETTING

:::info
This feature is available in Timeplus Enterprise v2.2.8 or above. Not available in Timeplus Proton.
:::

By default, the checkpoint will be updated every 15 minutes for materialized views. You can change the checkpoint interval without recreating the materialized views.

```sql
ALTER STREAM mv_with_inner_stream MODIFY QUERY SETTING checkpoint_interval=600
```

## RESET QUERY SETTING

:::info
This feature is available in Timeplus Enterprise v2.2.8 or above. Not available in Timeplus Proton.

By default, the checkpoint will be updated every 15 minutes for materialized views. After you change the interval you can reset it.

```sql
ALTER STREAM mv_with_inner_stream RESET QUERY SETTING checkpoint_interval
```
