# 改变流

Currently we don't recommend to alter the schema of streams in Timeplus. You can modify the retention policy for historical store.

You can also use `ALTER STREAM` to modify the setttings of materialized views (only available in Timeplus Enterprise).

## 修改 TTL

You can add or modify the retention policy. 例如 例如

```sql
ALTER STREAM stream_name MODIFY TTL to_datetime(created_at) + INTERVAL 48 HOUR
```

## MODIFY QUERY SETTING

:::info
This feature is available in Timeplus Enterprise v2.2.8 or above. Not available in Timeplus Proton.
:::

By default, the checkpoint will be updated every 15 minutes for materialized views. You can change the checkpoint interval without recreating the materialized views.

```sql
ALTER STREAM mv_with_inner_stream MODIFY QUERY SETTING checkpoint_interval=600
```

## RESET QUERY SETTING
