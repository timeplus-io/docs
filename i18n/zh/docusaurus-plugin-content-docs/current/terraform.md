# Timeplus Terraform Provider

HashiCorp Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files. You can version, reuse, and share files, using standardized resource management tooling, pipelines, and processes.

The [new Timeplus Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/timeplus-io/timeplus/latest) allows businesses to:

- Reduce complexity and risk with infrastructure managed as code and deployed through automated [GitOps](https://github.com/readme/featured/defining-gitops) integration
- Increase developer autonomy and productivity with consistent, version-controlled access to data streams, Apache Kafka sources, materialized views, dashboards, UDF, and more

With this Provider, Timeplus customers at any scale can safely accelerate data streaming initiatives in the cloud (public, private, or hybrid) with infrastructure management that is fully automated through code and integrated within continuous delivery workflows.
