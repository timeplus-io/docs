# CREATE STREAM

:::info note for Timeplus Cloud users

In Timeplus Cloud or Private Cloud deployments, we recommend you to create streams with GUI or [Terraform Provider](terraform), with better usability and more capabilities.

:::

## CREATE STREAM

[Stream](working-with-streams) is a key [concept](category/concepts) in Timeplus. All data lives in streams, no matter static data or data in motion. We don't recommend you to create or manage `TABLE` in Proton.

### Append-only Stream

By default, the streams are append-only and immutable. You can create a stream, then use `INSERT INTO` to add data.

Syntax:

```sql
CREATE STREAM [IF NOT EXISTS] [db.]<stream_name>
(
    <col_name1> <col_type_1> [DEFAULT <col_expr_1>] [compression_codec_1],
    <col_name1> <col_type_2> [DEFAULT <col_expr_2>] [compression_codec_2]
)
SETTINGS <event_time_column>='<col>', <key1>=<value1>, <key2>=<value2>, ...
```

:::info

Stream creation is an async process.

If you omit the database name, `default` will be used. Stream name can be any utf-8 characters and needs backtick quoted if there are spaces in between. Column name can be any utf-8 characters and needs backtick quoted if there are spaces in between.

#### Data types

Proton supports the following column types

1. int8/16/32/64/128/256
2. uint8/16/32/64/128/256
3. boolean
4. decimal(precision, scale) : valid range for precision is [1: 76], valid range for scale is [0: precision]
5. float32/64
6. 日期
7. dateTime
8. dateTime64(precision, [time_zone])
9. 字符串
10. fixed_string(N)
11. array(T)
12. uuid

#### Event Time

In Timeplus, each stream with a `_tp_time` as [Event Time](eventtime). If you don't create the `_tp_time` column when you create the stream, the system will create such a column for you, with `now64()` as the default value. You can also choose a column as the event time, using

```sql
SETTINGS event_time_column='my_datetime_col'
```

 It can be any sql expression which results in datetime64 type.

#### Retention Policies

Proton supports retention policies to automatically remove out-of-date data from the streams.

##### For Historical Storage

Proton leverages ClickHouse TTL expression for the retention policy of historical data. When you create the stream, you can add `TTL to_datetime(_tp_time) + INTERVAL 12 HOUR` to remove older events based a specific datetime column and retention period.

##### For Streaming Storage

Today it's not exposed in SQL to control the retention policies for streaming storage. In Timeplus Cloud, you can set them via

* logstore_retention_bytes
* logstore_retention_ms

### 多版本流

[Versioned Stream](versioned-stream) allows you to specify the primary key(s) and focus on the latest value. 例如：

```sql
CREATE STREAM versioned_kv(i int, k string, k1 string) 
PRIMARY KEY (k, k1) 
SETTINGS mode='versioned_kv', version_column='i';
```

The default `version_column` is `_tp_time`. For the data with same primary key(s), Proton will use the ones with maximum value of  `version_column`. So by default, it tracks the most recent data for same primary key(s). If there are late events, you can use specify other column to determine the end state for your live data.

### 变更日志流

[Changelog Stream](changelog-stream) allows you to specify the primary key(s) and track the add/delete/update of the data. 例如：

```sql
CREATE STREAM changelog_kv(i int, k string, k1 string) 
PRIMARY KEY (k, k1) 
SETTINGS mode='changelog_kv', version_column='i';
```

The default `version_column` is `_tp_time`. For the data with same primary key(s), Proton will use the ones with maximum value of  `version_column`. So by default, it tracks the most recent data for same primary key(s). If there are late events, you can use specify other column to determine the end state for your live data.

## CREATE RANDOM STREAM

You may use this special stream to generate random data for tests. 例如：

```sql
CREATE RANDOM STREAM devices(
  device string default 'device'||to_string(rand()%4), 
  location string default 'city'||to_string(rand()%10),
  temperature float default rand()%1000/10);
```

The following functions are available to use:

1. [rand](functions_for_random#rand) to generate a number in uint32
2. [rand64](functions_for_random#rand64) to generate a number in uint64
3. [random_printable_ascii](functions_for_random#random_printable_ascii) to generate printable characters
4. [random_string](functions_for_random#random_string) to generate a string
5. [random_fixed_string](functions_for_random#random_fixed_string) to generate string in fixed length
7. [random_in_type](functions_for_random#random_in_type) to generate value with max value and custom logic

The data of random stream is kept in memory during the query time. If you are not querying the random stream, there is no data generated or kept in memory.

By default, Proton tries to generate as many data as possible. If you want to (roughly) control how frequent the data is generated, you can use the `eps` setting. For example, the following SQL generates 10 event every second:

```sql
CREATE RANDOM STREAM rand_stream(i int default rand()%5) SETTINGS eps=10
```

Please note, the data generation rate is not accurate, to balance the performance and flow control.
