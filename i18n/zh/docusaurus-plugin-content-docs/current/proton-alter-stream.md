# ALTER STREAM

Currently we don't recommend to alter the schema of streams in Proton. The only exception is you can modify the retention policy for historical store.

## MODIFY TTL

You can add or modify the retention policy. 例如

```sql
ALTER STREAM stream_name MODIFY TTL to_datetime(created_at) + INTERVAL 48 HOUR
```
