# Timeplus Proton

Timeplus Proton, the core engine of Timeplus Enterprise, is fast and lightweight alternative to ksqlDB or Apache Flink. It enables developers to solve streaming data processing, routing and analytics challenges from Apache Kafka, Redpanda and more sources, and send aggregated data to the downstream systems. Timeplus Proton is under active development under Apache 2.0 license and powers [Timeplus Enterprise](timeplus-enterprise).

## 💪 Why use Timeplus Proton?

1. **[Apache Flink](https://github.com/apache/flink) or [ksqlDB](https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql) alternative.** Timeplus Proton provides powerful streaming SQL functionalities, such as streaming ETL, tumble/hop/session windows, watermarks, materialized views, CDC and data revision processing, etc.
2. **Fast.** Timeplus Proton is written in C++, with optimized performance through SIMD. [For example](https://www.timeplus.com/post/scary-fast), on an Apple MacBookPro with M2 Max, Timeplus Proton can deliver 90 million EPS, 4 millisecond end-to-end latency, and high cardinality aggregation with 1 million unique keys.
3. **Lightweight.** Timeplus Proton is a single binary (\<500MB). No JVM or any other dependencies. You can also run it with Docker, or on an AWS t2.nano instance (1 vCPU and 0.5 GiB memory).
4. **Powered by the fast, resource efficient and mature [ClickHouse](https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse).** Timeplus Proton extends the historical data, storage, and computing functionality of ClickHouse with stream processing. Thousands of SQL functions are available in Timeplus Proton. Billions of rows are queried in milliseconds.
5. **Best streaming SQL engine for [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) or [Redpanda](https://redpanda.com/).** Query the live data in Kafka or other compatible streaming data platforms, with [external streams](https://docs.timeplus.com/proton-kafka).

### Timeplus Cloud

One step to try Timeplus Proton in [Timeplus Cloud](https://us.timeplus.cloud/)

### 🔎 Usage

From `proton client`, run the following SQL to create a stream of random data:

```sql
-- Create a stream with random data
CREATE RANDOM STREAM devices(
  device string default 'device'||to_string(rand()%4),
  temperature float default rand()%1000/10)
```

```sql
-- Run the streaming SQL
SELECT device, count(*), min(temperature), max(temperature)
FROM devices GROUP BY device
```

You should see data like the following:

```
┌─device──┬─count()─┬─min(temperature)─┬─max(temperature)─┐
│ device0 │    2256 │                0 │             99.6 │
│ device1 │    2260 │              0.1 │             99.7 │
│ device3 │    2259 │              0.3 │             99.9 │
│ device2 │    2225 │              0.2 │             99.8 │
└─────────┴─────────┴──────────────────┴──────────────────┘
```
