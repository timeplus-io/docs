### Timeplus Enterprise Processes
This will start Timeplus Enterprise with a few key processes:
* `timeplusd`: The core SQL engine, severing at port 8463 (TCP, for `timeplus client`) and 3218 (HTTP, for JDBC/ODBC drivers
* `timeplus_appserver`: The application server, severing at HTTP port 8000
* `timeplus_web`: The web UI, managed by `timeplus_appserver`
* `timeplus_connector`: The service to provide extra sources and sinks, managed by `timeplus_appserver`

Access the Timeplus Enterprise web console via http://localhost:8000. On your first login, please create an account with a password to start the 30-day free trial.

It is also possible to only start/stop single process by running `timeplus start -s service_name`. For example, when you only want to startup Timeplus Core (SQL Engine), run `timeplus start -s timeplusd`.

For more information, please check the [CLI Reference](/cli-reference).

## Docker Install{#docker}

Alternatively, run the following command to start Timeplus Enterprise with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/):
```shell
docker run -p 8000:8000 timeplus/timeplus-enterprise
```

A few optional parameters:
* Add `--name timeplus` to set a name for the container
* Add `-d` to run the container in the background
* Add `-p 8463:8463 -p 3218:3218` if you want to run SQL with `timeplus client` or JDBC/ODBC drivers
* Add `-v "$(pwd)"/data:/timeplus/data -v "$(pwd)"/logs:/timeplus/logs` if you want to mount the data and log files to your host

## Quickstart with Docker Compose {#compose}
To try our demo kit, you can use Docker Compose to start Timeplus Enterprise, together with Redpanda (A Kafka API compatible message bus), ClickHouse and data generator.

For Linux or Mac users, please run the command:
```bash
curl https://install.timeplus.com/sp-demo | sh
```

For Windows users, you can download the package with Docker Compose file and bootstrap scripts [here](https://timeplus.io/dist/timeplus_enterprise/sp-demo-20240522.zip).

Access the Timeplus demo kit web console at https://localhost:8000.

This stack demonstrates how to run streaming ETL, getting data from Kafka API, applying filter or aggregation, then sending to another Kafka topic or ClickHouse tables. For more details, please see:
* [Tutorial – Streaming ETL: Kafka to Kafka](/tutorial-sql-etl)
* [Tutorial – Streaming ETL: Kafka to ClickHouse](/tutorial-sql-etl-kafka-to-ch)
