**Timeplus** is a simple, powerful, and cost-efficient vectorized stream processing platform built in modern C++. Its core processing engine is a **single binary with no external dependencies**, making it easy to operate in production — a key differentiator compared to other solutions.  

Timeplus provides end-to-end capabilities that help data teams process **both streaming and historical data** quickly and intuitively. It’s designed to be accessible for organizations of all sizes and industries, enabling data engineers and platform teams to unlock the value of streaming data using **streaming SQL**.  

Timeplus is available in multiple editions:

- **[Timeplus Proton](/proton)** – the open-source core engine, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/timeplus-io/proton) under the Apache 2.0 License. It is a **fast, lightweight streaming SQL engine** ideal for building streaming pipelines.  
- **[Timeplus Enterprise](https://www.timeplus.com/product)** – the production-ready commercial product, designed to run and scale anywhere, from the edge to your data center, and customizable to your specific configuration needs.  

Timeplus makes it easy to connect to diverse data sources—including **Apache Kafka, Confluent Cloud, Redpanda, NATS, WebSocket/SSE, CSV uploads**, and more. Users can explore streaming patterns with SQL queries, send real-time insights and alerts to other systems or individuals, and build dashboards and visualizations to monitor and analyze data in real time.
