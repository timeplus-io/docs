Timeplus is a simple, powerful, and cost-efficient stream processing platform.

Timeplus provides powerful end-to-end capabilities to help data teams process streaming and historical data quickly and intuitively, accessible for organizations of all sizes and industries. It enables data engineers and platform engineers to unlock streaming data value using SQL.

It's available in different ways:

- [Timeplus Proton](/proton): the core engine open-sourced at [GitHub](https://github.com/timeplus-io/proton) under Apache 2.0 License. It is a fast and lightweight streaming SQL engine.
- [Timeplus Enterprise](https://www.timeplus.com/product): the production-ready commercial product, with 2 deployment options:
  - Cloud: a fully-managed unified platform for streaming and historical data processing.
  - Self-hosted: same feature sets as Timeplus Cloud, able to run and scale everywhere, from edge to your data center. Customize according to your configuration needs.

Timeplus allows for easy connection to diverse data sources (such as Apache Kafka, Confluent Cloud, Redpanda, NATS, Web Socket/SSE, CSV file upload, and more), explore streaming patterns via SQL queries, send real-time insights and alerts to other systems or individuals, and create dashboards and visualizations.
