# Timeplus Enterprise 2.5
Each release of Timeplus Enterprise includes the following components:

* timeplusd: The core SQL engine
* timeplus_appserver: The application server to provide web console access and REST API
* timeplus_web: The web console static resources, managed by timeplus_appserver
* timeplus_connector: The service to provide extra sources and sinks, managed by timeplus_appserver
* timeplus: The CLI (Command Line Interface) to start/stop/manage the deployment.

Each component tracks their changes with own version numbers. The version number for each Timeplus Enterprise release is a verified combination of Timeplus components.
