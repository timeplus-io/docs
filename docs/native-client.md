# Timeplusd Client

Timeplus provides a native command-line client for executing SQL queries directly against a Timeplus server. It supports both interactive mode (for live query execution) and batch mode (for scripting and automation). Query results can be displayed in the terminal or exported to a file, with support for all Timeplus output formats, such as Pretty, CSV, JSON, and more.

The client provides real-time feedback on query execution with a progress bar and the number of rows read, bytes processed and query execution time. It supports both command-line options and configuration files.
