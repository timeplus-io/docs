# SQL Functions

Timeplus supports ANSI-SQL standard syntax. The following functions are provided for various use cases. Most of the [functions in ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions) are available in Timeplus, with different naming conventions (for example [array_join](/functions_for_comp#array_join) instead of [arrayJoin](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/array-join)). [New functions are added](/functions_for_streaming) for streaming processing. Please contact us if you need more functions.

Please note, in Timeplus Proton 1.3.27 or the earlier versions, SQL functions were case-sensitive and always in lower-case. Since 1.3.28, function names are case-insensitive. For example `count`, `COUNT` and `Count` work in the same way. SQL Keywords such as `SELECT` or `FROM` are case-insensitive too. In the rest of the documentation, we use function names in lower case for demonstration.
