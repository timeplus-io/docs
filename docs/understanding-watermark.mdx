# Understanding Watermark

In stream processing, a watermark is a mechanism used to track the progress of data processing in one or more streams. It helps determine when all events up to a specific timestamp have likely arrived, enabling the system to process time-based operations like [window aggregations](/stream-query#window-aggregation).

Since stream processing deals with unbounded, out-of-order data, watermarks are essential for defining bounded windows and for discarding late or outdated data in a consistent way. Watermarks allow the system to advance event-time, trigger computations (e.g., closing a [tumbling window](/functions_for_streaming#tumble) and [emitting results](/query-syntax#emit)), and maintain accuracy even when data arrives with delays.

## Try It Out

To better understand how watermarks work, use the following tool. It generates random data and simulates watermark progression for a tumbling window aggregation with a 5-second window size and a 2-second watermark delay.

You can click the **Play** button to start the simulation, or click the **Next** or **Prev** to view the next or previous step.
