# Logic

### if

`if(condition,yesValue,noValue)`

Controls conditional branching.

For example `if(1=2,'a','b')` will get `b`

### multi_if

`multi_if(condition1, then1, condition2, then2.. ,else)` An easier way to write if/self or case/when.

### sleep
`sleep(seconds)`

Not necessary as a logic function, but it is a function that can be used to pause the execution for a specified number of seconds.

For example `select sleep(2)` will pause the execution for 2 seconds.
