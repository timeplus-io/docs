# DROP ALERT
Starting from [Timeplus Enterprise 2.9](/enterprise-v2.9), you can create alerts to monitor your streaming data and automatically trigger actions when specific conditions are met.

## DROP ALERT
When you no longer need an alert, you can drop it with the following SQL:

```sql
DROP ALERT [IF EXISTS] [database.]alert_name;
```
