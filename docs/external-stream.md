# External Stream

You can also create **external streams** in Timeplus to query data in the external systems without loading the data into Timeplus. The main benefit for doing so is to keep a single source of truth in the external systems (e.g. Kafka), without duplicating them. In many cases, this can also achieve even lower latency to process Kafka data, because the data is read by Timeplus database, without other components.

You can run streaming analytics with the external streams in the similar way as other streams, with some limitations. 

## supported external systems

The supported external systems are:

* Open source Apache Kafka or Redpanda, without authentication. 
* Confluent Cloud with SASL Plain authentication.

The topics should contain messages in plain-text or JSON format. A single `raw` column will be created in the stream to capture the value of the messages in Kafka.

## create an external stream

To create an external stream, go to the **Data Ingestion** page, then click the **Add Data** button on the right side and choose **External Streams** in the popup dialog. Set the stream name, Kafka broker(s) and topic name. Choose the right authentication method and click **Create**. You cannot customize the stream schema. A single `raw` column will be created in the stream to capture the value of the messages in Kafka.

## query external streams

To query the data in the external systems, run the streaming SQL in the similar way for normal streams, e.g. `SELECT count(*) FROM my_external_stream` You can also create [views](view) or [materialized views](view#materialized-view) based on external streams.

## limitations

There are some limitations for the Kafka-based external streams, because Timeplus doesnâ€™t control the storage or the data format for the external stream.

1. Authentication is either None or SASL Plain. SASL Scram 256 or 512 is not supported yet.
2. Data format in JSON or TEXT format. AVRO or schema registry service is not supported yet. The entire message will be put in a `raw` string column.
3. Since the raw data is not stored in Timeplus, we cannot attach event time or index time for each event at ingestion time. You can specify the event time with an expression in the query, such as `tumble(ext_stream,to_time(raw:order_time),1m)`
4. Unlike normal streams, there is no historical storage for the external streams. Hence you cannot run `table(my_ext_stream)`or `settings query_mode='table'` To access data even before you create the external stream, you can use `WHERE _tp_time >'2023-01-15'` to travel to a specific timestamp in the past.
5. There is no retention policy for the external streams in Timeplus. You need to configure the retention policy on Kafka/Confluent/Redpanda. If the data is no longer available in the external systems, they cannot be searched in Timeplus either.
