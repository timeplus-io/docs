# Private Beta 1

We are thrilled to launch the first private beta of Timeplus cloud release. A lot of cool features and unlimited possibilities. We will update the beta version from time to time and list key enhancements in this page.

(in year 2022)

###  Week of 8/1

Last weekly release in Private Beta 1. Starting from August 8, we are transiting to Private Beta 2. Customers will be migrated to the new environments batch by batch. URLs to access beta tenants are changed from [https://TENANT.beta.timeplus.com](https://tenant.beta.timeplus.com) to [https://beta.timeplus.cloud/TENANT](https://beta.timeplus.cloud/tenant)

* Streaming engine
  * Added 2 geo related functions: [point_in_polygon](functions#point_in_polygon) and [geo_distance](functions#geo_distance). 

* Source, sink, API and SDK
  * Updated the layout of the "Sources" page to leave more space for the source definitions. 
* UI improvements
  * Added a visual indicator on the query tab if the query is running.
  * Updated the error or page-not-found screens.

### Week of 7/25

* Streaming engine
  * Enhanced [json_extract_array](functions#json_extract_array) function to return clean string values. `select '{"a":1,"tags":["x","y"]}' as raw, json_extract_array(raw:tags)`now returns ` [ "x", "y" ]` , instead of ` [ "\"x\"", "\"y\"" ]` in the previous releases.
  * Added a new shortcut to access json arrays without having to use the [json_extract_array](functions#json_extract_array) function. The above query can be simplified as `select '{"a":1,"tags":["x","y"]}' as raw, raw:tags[*]`
  * Refined typing system and logical comparisons return `bool` instead of `uint8`
* Source, sink, API and SDK
  * All Timeplus sinks now use the `{{.columnName}}` syntax to access the column value in the sink title or body. Numbers and other primitive types are supported (previously only string columns are supported).
  * Fixed an issue that canceled queries could be marked as finished.
  * Fixed an issue that EPS(event per second) won't be shown if the query finishes too fast.
* UI improvements
  * Added a new option in the 'Send data to..' dialog to send the results to a stream in the Timeplus tenant.
  * Show the number of running queries when you create a new query tab.
  * Enhanced the font colors.
  * Enhanced the chart colors.

### Week of 7/18

* Streaming engine
  * Refined the behavior of [materialized views](view#m_view), to keep it consistent with the other Timeplus queries. `SELECT * FROM table(a_materialized_view)` will get all past results, instead of the recent one. 
  * Added the [count_if](functions#count_if) function and [unique_exact_if](functions#unique_exact_if) function to count the number of rows or unique value matching certain conditions.
  * Added [json_extract_keys](functions#json_extract_keys) function to get the keys for the JSON map object.
  * Added the [to_bool](functions_for_type#to_bool) function to convert other types to `bool`
  * Added [is_nan](functions#is_nan), [is_infinite](functions#is_infinite), [is_finite](functions#is_finite) functions to detect the edge cases when a number column contains infinite numbers, etc.
  * Added [to_type_name](functions_for_type#to_type_name) function to show the data type name, mainly for troubleshooting purposes.

* Source, sink, API and SDK
  * Updated the [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/timeplus/0.1.10/) to show the metrics
* UI improvements
  * Added new visualization types: bar chart and streaming table
  * Enhanced the management page of sinks, to show the sink status, number of messages sent, failure count, etc.
  * Enhanced the SQL editor to highlight the beginning/ending (),{},[]. This could be very helpful for complex SQLs with nested function calls.

### Week of 7/11

* Streaming engine
  * Fixed an issue of [lags](functions#lags) function to get a range of past results for the specific column
  * Exposed the [coalesce](functions#coalesce) function to skip null value and return the first non-`NULL` value. Many functions expect the arguments cannot be `NULL`

* Source, sink, API and SDK
  * Updated the [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/timeplus/0.1.10/) to support the new source API and add authentication to websockets
  * Added the optional description field for sinks
* UI improvements
  * Show the newly-opened query tab such as 'Tab 1', or 'Tab 2', instead of 'Untitled'
  * Able to delete the first query tab
  * Consolidated various streamlit demos to [a single URL](https://timeplus.streamlitapp.com/)

### Week of 6/13

* Streaming engine
  * Added new function [moving_sum](functions#moving_sum) to calculate the moving sum for a column. This unlocks more use cases of stateful streaming processing, such as [streaming over](https://share.streamlit.io/timeplus-io/github_liveview/develop/stream_over.py).
  * Added other functions for [array processing](functions#arrays), such as [array_sum](functions#array_sum), [array_avg](functions#array_avg)
* Source and sink
  * Kafka source supports local schema registry without authentication 
* UI improvements
  * Added validation while creating streams. The stream name should start with a letter and the rest of the name only include number, letter or _
  * Disable the Next button in the source wizard if the data is not previewed

### Week of 6/6

* Streaming engine
  * More [math functions](functions#math) are exposed. This can help you to run SQL-based simple ML/prediction models.
  * (Experimental) [stream-to-stream join](query-syntax#stream_stream_join) no longer requires a ` date_diff_within(..)`, although it's still recommended to add timestamp constraints to improve performance. 
  * (Experimental) able to set a retention policy for each stream, either time-based (say only keep recent 7 days' data), or size based(say only keep recent 1GB data)
* Source and sink
  * (Experimental) support Personal Access Token (PAT) in the REST API, which is long-living (or set an expiration date) and per-user. Tenant-level access token will be deprecated. 
* UI improvements
  * After the sources or sinks are created, now you can edit them without having to delete and recreate them.
  * Great performance improvement for live tables/charts.

### Week of 5/30

* Streaming engine
  * (Experimental) able to use the external Kafka/Confluent/Redpanda as Timeplus stream storage.
  * (Experimental) the [table](functions#table) function now works with [seek_to](query-syntax) You can query historical data by combining `table(streamName)` and `settings seek_to='..'`
* Source and sink
  * Worked with [datapm](https://datapm.io/docs/quick-start/) to send live Twitter data to https://demo.timeplus.com 
  * Updated the [REST API doc](https://docs.timeplus.com/rest.html), the `/exec` endpoint has been removed. Send `POST` requests to `/queries` instead.
* UI improvements
  * Able to drag-n-drop to change the order of query tabs

### Week of 5/23

* Streaming engine
  * (Experimental) new UI and API to create and query [external streams](working-with-streams#external_stream). You can query real-time data in Confluent Cloud, Apache Kafka or Redpanda immediately, without loading the data into Timeplus.
  * (Experimental) [stream-to-stream join](query-syntax#stream_stream_join) is ready to test for beta customers, e.g. `SELECT .. FROM stream1 INNER JOIN stream2 ON stream1.id=stream2.id AND date_diff_within(10s)`
  * New function [date_diff_within](functions#date_diff_within) to determine whether 2 datetime are within the specified range. This is necessary for stream to stream join. You can also use more flexible expressions like `date_diff('second',left.time,right.time) between -3 and 5`
* Source and sink
  * Enhanced the [datapm](https://datapm.io/docs/quick-start/) Timeplus sink to support loading JSON data from PostgreSQL.
  * When you are previewing data from Kafka, you can choose the timezone if the time zone is not included in the raw data.
* UI improvements
  * Able to edit the panel titles on dashboards.
  * Improve UI consistency.

### Week of 5/16

* Streaming engine
  * (Experimental) greatly simplified how to query JSON documents. Now you can use `json_doc:json_path` as a shortcut to extract value in the JSON document. For example `select '{"c":"hello"}' as j, j:c`, you will get "hello" as the value. In the past, you have to call `json_extract_string(j,'c')` Nested structures are support too, such as `select '{"a":{"b":1}}' as j, j:a.b` will get `1` as a string value. To convert to int, you can use `::` as the shortcut, e.g. `select '{"a":{"b":1}}' as j, j:a.b::int`
  * Added a function [is_valid_json](functions#is_valid_json) to check whether the specific string is a valid JSON document, e.g. `select j:a where is_valid_json(j)`
  * Added `varchar` as an alias for `string` data type. This could improve the compatibility with other SQL tools.
* Source and sink
  * Enhanced the authentication for Kafka/Redpanda source: added new SASL mechanisms: scram-sha-256 and scram-sha-512, added config to disable TLS, added config to skip verifying server when TLS is enabled, fixed a bug that the source will hang if authentication fails.
  * Enhanced the [REST API](https://docs.timeplus.com/rest.html) to specify the timezone for event timestamps in the raw event.
* UI improvements
  * Refresh stream list after creating streams or views.
  * Show the source configuration JSON in a better tree view.

### Week of 5/9

* Streaming engine
  * New [array_join](functions#array_join) function to generate a set of rows based on the value in the array, joining with other columns
