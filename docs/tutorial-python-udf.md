# Python UDF for Real-Time Machine Learning

SQL and Python are two of the most widely used tools in the data domain, both have their strengths and weaknesses, and understanding when to use each can help maximize efficiency and performance in data analysis, machine learning, and data transformation tasks.

Timeplus is a unified streaming SQL platform designed for high performance and efficiency, all within a single binary. Its primary interface is SQL, which comes with inherent limitations, as mentioned earlier. To address these constraints, Timeplus has recently introduced a new feature: Python user-defined functions (UDFs). With Python UDFs, users can seamlessly integrate Python functions into SQL queries, bridging the gap between SQL and Python. This enhancement enables developers and data engineers to leverage the strengths of both languages within a single platform, unlocking greater flexibility and capability.
