# Timeplus Enterprise 2.4
Each release of Timeplus Enterprise includes the following components:

* timeplusd: The core SQL engine
* timeplus_appserver: The application server to provide web console access and REST API
* timeplus_web: The web console static resources, managed by timeplus_appserver
* timeplus_connnector: The service to provide extra sources and sinks, managed by timeplus_appserver
* timeplus: The CLI (Command Line Interface) to start/stop/manage the deployment.

Each component tracks their changes with own version numbers. The version number for each Timeplus Enterprise release is a verified combination of Timeplus components.

## Key Highlights
Key highlights of this release:
* [Mutable Streams](mutable-stream) for fast UPSERT and high performance point or range queries
* [External Streams](timeplus-external-stream) to query or write to remote Timeplus, designed for data migration or hybird deployment
* Read/write Kafka message keys via [_tp_message_key column](proton-kafka#messagekey)
* [Kafka schema registry support for Avro output format](proton-schema-registry#write)
* [Timeplus Native JDBC](jdbc) with streaming SQL and fast insert

#### Known issues {#known_issue_2_4_15}
1. If you have deployed one of the [2.3.x releases](enterprise-v2.3), you cannot reuse the data and configuration directly. Please have a clean installation of 2.4.x release, then use tools like [timeplus sync](cli-sync) CLI or [Timeplus External Stream](timeplus-external-stream) for migration.
2. In Timeplus Console, no result will be shown for SQL [SHOW FORMAT SCHEMAS](sql-show-format-schemas) or [SHOW FUNCTIONS](sql-show-functions). This only impacts the web interface. Running such SQL via `timeplusd client` CLI or JDBC/ODBC will get the expected results.
3. For [timeplus user](cli-user) CLI, you need to add `--verbose` to `timeplus user list` command, in order to list users.
