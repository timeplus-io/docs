# USE
Starting from [Timeplus Enterprise 2.6](/enterprise-v2.6), you can create a database to organize Timeplus streams, materialized views, or connect to other systems such as MySQL and Iceberg without creating multiple external tables repeating the connection information.

Once the database is created, run `USE my_database` to switch to the database.

```sql
USE my_database;
```
