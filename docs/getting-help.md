### Create A Support Ticket {#ticket}
Customers of Timeplus Enterprise can open support tickets by emailing [support@timeplus.com](mailto:support@timeplus.com) or accessing [the support web portal](https://support.timeplus.com/tickets) to open a new ticket.

For Timeplus Enterprise in the cloud, you can also use the "Talk to Us" button on the top bar to contact us.

### Diagnostic Bundle {#diag}
For self-hosted Timeplus Enterprise deployments, run `timeplus diag` from the `timeplus/bin` folder to collect diagnostic information when Timeplus Enterprise is running. A diagnostic file will be generated under the `timeplus/logs` directory. When creating a support ticket, you may package the logs directory as a zip and attach it in the support ticket.
