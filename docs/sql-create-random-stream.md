# CREATE RANDOM STREAM

You may use this special stream to generate random data for tests. For example:

```sql
CREATE RANDOM STREAM devices(
  device string default 'device'||to_string(rand()%4),
  location string default 'city'||to_string(rand()%10),
  temperature float default rand()%1000/10);
```

The following functions are available to use:

1. [rand](/functions_for_random#rand) to generate a number in uint32
2. [rand64](/functions_for_random#rand64) to generate a number in uint64
3. [random_printable_ascii](/functions_for_random#random_printable_ascii) to generate printable characters
4. [random_string](/functions_for_random#random_string) to generate a string
5. [random_fixed_string](/functions_for_random#random_fixed_string) to generate string in fixed length
7. [random_in_type](/functions_for_random#random_in_type) to generate value with max value and custom logic

The data of random stream is kept in memory during the query time. If you are not querying the random stream, there is no data generated or kept in memory.

By default, Proton tries to generate as many data as possible. If you want to (roughly) control how frequent the data is generated, you can use the `eps` setting. For example, the following SQL generates 10 events every second:

```sql
CREATE RANDOM STREAM rand_stream(i int default rand()%5) SETTINGS eps=10
```

You can further customize the rate of data generation via the `interval_time` setting. For example, you want to generate 1000 events each second, but don't want all 1000 events are generated at once, you can use the following sample SQL to generate events every 200 ms. The default interval is 5ms (in Proton 1.3.27 or the earlier versions, the default value is 100ms)

```sql
CREATE RANDOM STREAM rand_stream(i int default rand()%5) SETTINGS eps=1000, interval_time=200
```

Please note, the data generation rate is not accurate, to balance the performance and flow control.

:::info

New in Proton v1.4.2, you can set eps less than 1. Such as `eps=0.5` will generate 1 event every 2 seconds. `eps` less than 0.00001 will be treated as 0.
