# SHOW DATABASES
Starting from [Timeplus Enterprise 2.6](/enterprise-v2.6), you can create a database to organize your streams, materialized views and other resources. The database is a logical container to help you to manage and query the data more efficiently.

You can list all the databases in the cluster with the following SQL:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```
