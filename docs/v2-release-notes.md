* Updated a few [examples](https://github.com/timeplus-io/proton/tree/develop/examples)
  * [CDC(Change Data Capture)](https://github.com/timeplus-io/proton/tree/develop/examples/cdc) example with Debezium and MySQL.
  * Use latest [Grafana Plugin](https://github.com/timeplus-io/proton-grafana-source) in [IoT demo with awesome sensor app](https://github.com/timeplus-io/proton/tree/develop/examples/awesome-sensor-logger) and [Carsharing data generator](https://github.com/timeplus-io/proton/tree/develop/examples/grafana).
  * A new sample to [detect idle stream ingestion](https://github.com/timeplus-io/proton/tree/develop/examples/broken-stream-monitor) using the new [EMIT PERIODIC .. REPEAT](/query-syntax#emit_periodic_repeat) syntax.

### Timeplus Native JDBC v2.0.7
* Fixed the issue of getTables method in [TimeplusDatabaseMetadata](https://github.com/timeplus-io/timeplus-native-jdbc/blob/main/timeplus-native-jdbc/src/main/java/com/timeplus/jdbc/TimeplusDatabaseMetadata.java), so that Timeplus streams, views and materialized views can be listed in SQL tools.
* Better dependency management and minor bug fixes.

## Nov 11, 2024

### Timeplus Proton v1.6.2
* Added a new [EMIT policy](/query-syntax#emit) in streaming SQL with global aggregation. The new [EMIT PERIODIC .. REPEAT](/query-syntax#emit_periodic_repeat) syntax will show the last aggregation result even there is no new event.
* Fixed a bug that views with incorrect syntax could be created.

### Timeplus Grafana plugin v2.0.0
* The new release of Timeplus Grafana Plugin v2.0, available now on [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/timeplus-io/proton-grafana-source). This latest version introduces significant improvements in both performance and stability. Whether you’re using Timeplus Enterprise or the open-source Timeplus Proton, this plugin allows you to seamlessly monitor real-time data through Grafana, utilizing both simple and complex analytics to track live data trends.

### Documentation Updates
* Updated the guide of [Ingest REST API](/ingest-api) to add more instructions for self-hosting Timeplus Enterprise. API keys are only available in Timeplus Cloud. For self-hosting deployment, please encode the username and password with base64, and set it in the HTTP Authorization header.
* Updated the structure of [Kafka external stream](/proton-kafka). Mentioned `RawBLOB` as a supported data format.
* Added documentation for materialized view [load balancing](/proton-create-view#memory_weight).

## Oct 28, 2024

### Timeplus Proton v1.6.1
* Fixed the issue that [SHOW CREATE STREAM](/sql-show-create) doesn't work. Since this version, you can run either `SHOW CREATE stream_name` or `SHOW CREATE STREAM stream_name`.
* Refined the display of datetime value in `proton client`. Same behavior as before, if the timezone is not specified. For `datetime('UTC')`, "Z" will be shown at the end. For other timezones, such as `datetime('Europe/London')`, the full timezone offset will be shown, such as "2024-09-10 18:21:46+01:00".

### Timeplus Python Driver v0.2.11
* [The new version](https://github.com/timeplus-io/proton-python-driver/releases/tag/v0.2.11) adds support for Python 3.13.

### Sling v1.2.21 and v1.2.22
[Sling](/sling) is a CLI tool that extracts data from a source storage/database and loads it in a target storage/database. You can use sling to export data from one Timeplus deployment and import to the other Timeplus deployment. In these 2 releases, we contributed a few new features and enhancements:
* Added new `SLING_DIRECT_INSERT` environment variable to enable direct data inserts from source Timeplus to the target Timeplus, bypassing a temporary table.
* By default, the exported CSV files use " to quote the value. Now this can be customized to any value, such as `$a,b$`, instead of `"a,b"`.

### Documentation Updates
* The top navigation bar is updated to provide quick accesses to the major steps to use Timeplus.
* Refined [Insert Idempotency](/idempotent) page to highlight `x-timeplus-idempotent-id` is available in Ingest REST API. Also explained the `max_idempotent_ids` setting.
* Added documentations for function [format_readable_quantity](/functions_for_text#format_readable_quantity) and [format_readable_size](/functions_for_text#format_readable_size).

## Oct 14, 2024

## Jun 24, 2024

Timeplus Enterprise v2 is now available for cloud or self-hosted deployment. [See installation options](https://timeplus.com/product) for self-hosting.

### Timeplus Enterprise v2.3.0
*Self-Hosted:*
  * Account setup flow for self-hosted deployment: create account and login screens.
  * License management: In Workspace Settings, see your existing licenses and entitlements. [Contact us](mailto:support@timeplus.com) to purchase a new license, then enter the license key and upload the license file in Workspace Settings.
  * Usage monitoring: Also in Workspace Settings, see your daily usage for ingested data and scanned external stream data.
  * Preview: Python User-Defined Functions (UDF). Create UDFs by leveraging Python libraries, such as pandas. [Contact us](mailto:support@timeplus.com) to try this feature.

### Timeplus Proton v1.5.11
  * When creating an external stream for Apache Kafka and running `select count() from table(stream)`, Timeplus Proton will retrieve the number of messages in the Kafka topic. If you set `data_format = "RawBLOB", one_message_per_row=false`, Proton will use the Kafka offset to get the message count. But if `one_message_per_row=true`, then Proton will read each message to split the rows. It won’t retrieve the result as fast as calculating the offset, but it will be more accurate.
  * When using an external stream to write data to Kafka, a new setting `kafka_max_message_size` is now available. When the external stream is created with `data_format='JSONEachRow',one_message_per_row=false`, each message in Kafka may contain multiple rows, with each row being a JSON document. This new setting `kafka_max_message_size` will control how much data will be put in a Kafka message and when to create a new Kafka message, ensuring each message won't exceed the `kafka_max_message_size` limit.
  * New function: [array_fold](/functions_for_comp#array_fold), which is equivalent to the Array.reduce function in JavaScript, and is used to fold or reduce the elements in an array from left to right by applying a lambda-function to the array elements in a cumulative manner.
  * `array_max/min` functions now support datetime.
