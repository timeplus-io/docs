### Timeplus Enterprise v2.6
[Timeplus Enterprise v2.6](/enterprise-v2.6) is now Generally Available! Key breakthroughs:
* **Revolutionary hybrid hash table technology.** For streaming SQL with JOINs or aggregations, by default a memory based hash table is used. This is helpful for preventing the memory limits from being exceeded for large data streams with hundreds of GB of data. You can adjust the query setting to apply the new hybrid hash table, which uses both the memory and the local disk to store the internal state as a hash table.
* **Enhanced operational visibility.** Gain complete transparency into your system's performance through comprehensive monitoring of materialized views and streams. Track state changes, errors, and throughput metrics via [system.stream_state_log](/system-stream-state-log) and [system.stream_metric_log](/system-stream-metric-log).
* **Advanced cross-deployment integration.** Seamlessly write data to remote Timeplus deployments by configuring [Timeplus external stream](/timeplus-external-stream) as targets in materialized views.
* **Improved data management capabilities.** Add new columns to an existing stream. Truncate historical data for streams. Create new databases to organize your streams and materialized views.
* **Optimized ClickHouse integration.** Significant performance improvements for read/write operations with ClickHouse external tables.
* **Enhanced user experience.** New UI wizards for Coinbase data sources and Apache Pulsar external streams, alongside a redesigned SQL Console and SQL Helper interface for improved usability. Quick access to streams, dashboards, and common actions via Command+K (Mac) or Windows+K (PC) keyboard shortcuts.

### Timeplus Proton v1.6.9

### Timeplus Proton v1.5.11
  * When creating an external stream for Apache Kafka and running `select count() from table(stream)`, Timeplus Proton will retrieve the number of messages in the Kafka topic. If you set `data_format = "RawBLOB", one_message_per_row=false`, Proton will use the Kafka offset to get the message count. But if `one_message_per_row=true`, then Proton will read each message to split the rows. It won’t retrieve the result as fast as calculating the offset, but it will be more accurate.
  * When using an external stream to write data to Kafka, a new setting `kafka_max_message_size` is now available. When the external stream is created with `data_format='JSONEachRow',one_message_per_row=false`, each message in Kafka may contain multiple rows, with each row being a JSON document. This new setting `kafka_max_message_size` will control how much data will be put in a Kafka message and when to create a new Kafka message, ensuring each message won't exceed the `kafka_max_message_size` limit.
  * New function: [array_fold](/functions_for_comp#array_fold), which is equivalent to the Array.reduce function in JavaScript, and is used to fold or reduce the elements in an array from left to right by applying a lambda-function to the array elements in a cumulative manner.
  * `array_max/min` functions now support datetime.
