# Server Configuration

When you run Timeplus Enterprise in a self-hosted environment, the default settings are designed to accommodate common use cases with ease and optimal performance. The server can be configured either by modifying the configuration file or via the web console.

## User Management {#users}

For single node deployments, when you launch the web console of Timeplus Enterprise for the first time, you will be prompted to create a new account with password.

For multi-node clusters deployed via [Helm Chart](/k8s-helm), please set the system account and user accounts in the values.yaml. The system account is created automatically for internal components to communicate to each other. The username is `proton`, with the password defaulting to `timeplusd@t+`.

To edit or add new users, you can use the [timeplus user](/cli-user) CLI or container, which supports bare metal and Kubernetes, both single node and multi-node.

## License Management{#license}

Your 30-day free trial starts when you start Timeplus Enterprise and access the web console for the first time. When your free trial ends, Timeplus Enterprise will stop working.

You can [contact us](mailto:support@timeplus.com) to purchase a license, then upload it in the web console. Click *Workspace Settings* in the left navigation menu and choose the *License* tab. Copy and paste the license file or upload the file.

You can also import a license by running the following command when Timeplus Enterprise is running.

```
./bin/timeplus license import -h license_key -h license_filepath
```

## Enable HTTPS {#https}

By default, Timeplus Enterprise web console is running on 8000, on a plain HTTP port. If you need to turn on self-signed or CA-signed HTTPS, you can edit conf/timeplus_appserver.yaml as follows:

```yaml
server-port: 8443
tls: true
cert: ../cert/ca.crt
key: ../cert/ca.key
```

To create a self-signed certificate, follow [this doc](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/securing_networks/creating-and-managing-tls-keys-and-certificates_securing-networks) and put the certificate files in the `timeplus/cert` folder.

Stop and restart Timeplus after the configuration change.

## Run as a system service {#service}

To run Timeplus Enterprise as a service, you need a OS that supports `systemd`.

To install it as a systemd service, run `sudo ./bin/timeplus service enable -u user -g user_group`.

Note:

1. Root privilege is required to enable the service
2. Use the same user/user_group for uncompressing the Timeplus installation package
3. This command will add a service into `/etc/systemd/system/timeplus.service`. When it is successfully installed, it will enable and start the service. Later on you can use `systemctl` command to manage the service.

## Timeplus Appserver configurations {#appserver}

```yaml
# The maximum number of tcp connections to timeplusd in the idle connection pool
